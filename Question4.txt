4. The most significant improvement HTTP 1.1 introduced over HTTP
1.0 was persisted connection by default. Why that made a difference?



HTTP 1.0 opens a new connection for each request/response pair and the close the
connection after each response.
By allowing persistent connection by default, HTTP 1.1 turns possible to have 
more than one request/response on the same HTTP connection.
By opening and closing fewer TCP connections, CPU time is saved. Networking 
congestion and latency on subsequent requests are reduced.
